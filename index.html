            <p>The Bodyguard is a 1992 American romantic thriller film directed by Mick Jackson,[4] written by Lawrence Kasdan, and starring Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston (in her acting debut), Gary Kemp, Bill Cobbs, and Ralph Waite. It follows a former Secret Service agent turned bodyguard who is hired to protect a music superstar from an unknown stalker. Kasdan wrote the film in the mid-1970s, originally as a vehicle for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.[5]

            The Bodyguard was theatrically released on November 25, 1992 by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film grossed $411 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1992 and at the time of its release the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time. However, it was panned by the critics who criticized its screenplay and performances of the lead actors, but its soundtrack garnered positive reviews and became the best-selling soundtrack album of all time, selling more than 45 million copies worldwide. The soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year whereas the singles "I Have Nothing" and "Run to You" received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[6] The film received seven nominations at the 13th Golden Raspberry Awards, including for the Worst Picture, Worst Actor (for Costner), and Worst Actress (for Houston).
